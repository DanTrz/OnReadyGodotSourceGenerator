 Generate OnReady Fields and Attributes to initiate variables on _Ready() similar to GDSCRIPT

This repo contains a simplified solution to resolve fields in Godot using C# by appllying a OnReady attribute to the fields we want to load, similar to using @onready in GDScript. 

This solution was done using my own code and the approach is a simple one that only does one purpose.

This was inspired by other solutions from:
